  <h1 style="text-align: center">About me:</h1>
        <p>Hi again! My name is Samuel Lam, an 18-year-old student in Arts program Global Business and Digital Arts
				 at the University of Waterloo. 
          I immigrated from Hong Kong to Canada Ontario in 2013 and have always loved it here. 
          I occasionally visit Hong Kong every few years just to hangout with my relatives again.
          Beyond studying, I life a pretty normal life, I often hangout with friends on my free time 
      		or go shopping with my parents! </p>
      
<h2>My Interests:</h2>
  <p>My intersts and hobbies throughout my life has always been about cars! When I was little, I always have toy
    cars in my hand whereever I go. Since I got my license on my 16th Birthday, I love driving, going on drives 
      and even exploring Car Meets. My dream car right now is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M4"">BMW M4</a>. 
        It is stylish and a really nice sports car!
        My intersts has expanded over the years and I
    love traveling and exporing different places and cultures around the world.
      I also try to keep myself in shape and sometimes go workout with my friends.</p>

      <h1>Future Plans</h1>
      <p>I'm really excited about the next few years in GBDA and the chance to gain hands-on experience through co-op! 
        I'm eager to gain learning and work experience on projects.
        I'm also looking forward to the possibility of traveling to places around Europe. Exploring new cultures and environments has always been something I would like to do.
        Additionally, I'm excited about spending more time with friends and family during the Christmas break! 
        These upcoming years feel like a great mix of professional and personal growth, and I can't wait to make the most of every opportunity.
